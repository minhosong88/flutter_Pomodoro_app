    "## Stateful Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "`Stateful widgets` allow widgets to hold data and see the change of data in real-time. They consist of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Widget itself**\n",
    "2. **The State of the Widget:** This is where we put the data and the UI of the widget. When the data changes, the UI of the widget changes along with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Stateful Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data in State:** The state holds the data as a Dart class property. It also holds the UI of the widget.\n",
    "- **UI Update:** When the data in the state changes, the UI changes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `setState`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `setState` function is used to notify the State class that the data has changed, so that the UI can be updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you don't call the `setState` function, the build method won't run again, and the UI won't refresh.\n",
    "- It is not necessary to wrap every data-changing portion with `setState`, but doing so can improve readability.\n",

    "### Theme and Context in Flutter\n",
    "\n",
    "Flutter has a powerful feature that saves all the specific styles for components, called `Theme`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the theme from a separate class, you need to interact with `_MainAppState` where the theme of the text is defined. You can do this by using the `context`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Context provides information about all the parent components, which allows child classes to use components of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",

    "`color: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge!.color`:\n",
    "1. Accesses the current theme's TextTheme through the context.\n",
    "2. Retrieves the titleLarge text style from the TextTheme.\n",
    "3. Uses the null assertion operator to ensure that titleLarge is not null.\n",
    "4. Sets the color of the text to the color defined in the titleLarge text style.\n",

    "* Here, it uses `!` to signify that you are sure that the value is not null. \n",

    "### StatefulWidget Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateful widgets in Flutter have a lifecycle, which includes several methods that are called at different stages during the widget's existence. Two important methods in this lifecycle are `initState` and `dispose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `initState` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `initState` method is used for the initialization of the state. Most of the time, you don't need this method because you can initialize state variables by simply declaring them. However, there are specific scenarios where `initState` becomes necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the widget needs to initialize some data that depends on parent classes.\n",
    "- When the widget needs the `context` to initialize data.\n",
    "- When the widget needs to subscribe to an API for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `initState` method should be called once and is declared before the `build` method. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "@override\n",
    "void initState() {\n",
    "  super.initState();\n",
    "  // Initialize your state variables or perform other initialization tasks here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### `dispose` Method\n",
    "The `dispose` method is called when the widget is removed from the screen. This method is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsubscribing from APIs.\n",
    "Removing listeners or other resources that need to be cleaned up.\n",
    "\n",
    "```dart\n",
    "@override\n",
    "void dispose() {\n",
    "  // Clean up resources or unsubscribe from listeners here\n",
    "  super.dispose();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "* `initState`: Called once before the build method. Used for initializing state, subscribing to services, or setting up listeners.\n",
    "* `build`: Called whenever the widget needs to be rendered. This method can be called multiple times during the lifecycle of the widget.\n",
    "* `dispose`: Called when the widget is removed from the screen. Used for cleaning up resources and unsubscribing from services.\n"
